\# DAILY\_SYNC — 2025-08-08



\## What we did

\- ✅ Confirmed end-to-end assessment flow works with server action accepting \*\*email\*\* or \*\*user\_id\*\*.

\- ✅ Implemented UI→DB mappings for journey/learning/goal to satisfy Neon check constraints.

\- ✅ Computed and stored AI readiness score; verified via `/api/dev/inventory`.

\- ✅ Designed and added industry comparison:

&nbsp; - API: `/api/industry-stats` — returns industry and role-level averages plus a recent sample.

&nbsp; - UI: `IndustryComparisonChart` — fail-soft rendering (friendly message if not enough peer data).

\- ✅ Seeded peer rows via `curl` (Windows single-line) to populate averages.

\- ✅ Clarified GitHub setup (public repo): \*\*owner\*\* `Edolszanowski`, \*\*repo\*\* `CareerOS-6t`, local path `C:\\Users\\edoly\\CareerOS`.



\## Blockers / Risks

\- None blocking. Industry stats routes/components must exist in the repo and be wired on the dashboard.

\- Auth is deferred — remember to add data protection governance before newsletter/goal features.



\## Decisions

\- Keep current schema, questions, and frontend; only adapt mappings and APIs as needed.

\- Weekly releases; can push daily while not live.



\## Next

1\. \*\*Finish GitHub integration\*\* for industry stats (branch → commit → push → PR).

2\. Wire `IndustryComparisonChart` on dashboard with props from latest assessment.

3\. Add a few more seeded assessments for richer averages.

4\. Start drafting newsletter fields and n8n integration plan (P1).
